Category Classification Analysis on the Indonesian Language Viva.co.id News Portal Using the Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm

In the digital era, the amount of information generated and disseminated through news portals is increasing exponentially. News portals such as Viva.co.id present various kinds of articles covering various categories, such as politics, economics, sports, technology, entertainment and others. Given the large volume of content produced, an automatic system is needed to classify news articles into the right categories, to make it easier for users to find relevant information.

Text Mining is a technique used to extract valuable information from text, and one of its important applications is text classification. In this context, the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm has become one of the most popular and effective methods for text classification, mainly because of its simplicity and computational speed.

Naive Bayes Classifier works based on Bayes' theorem, with the assumption that each feature in the data (in this case, the words in the article) is independent of each other. Although this assumption is rarely true in real cases, these algorithms often provide excellent results in text classification.

In this research, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify articles from the Viva.co.id news portal into appropriate categories based on the text in the article. The process begins with collecting text data from articles that have been published on Viva.co.id. This data is then processed through several preprocessing stages such as stopword removal, stemming, and tokenization to ensure that the analyzed text is ready to be inserted into the model.

After preprocessing, the Naive Bayes model is trained using a pre-labeled dataset, where each article has been categorized into one of the specific categories. This model is then used to predict the category of new articles whose categories are not yet known. Model accuracy is assessed based on how well the resulting category predictions match the actual categories of the article.

The results of this research show that the Naive Bayes Classifier is able to classify news articles on Viva.co.id with a sufficient level of accuracy. This shows the great potential of applying text mining and Naive Bayes algorithms in automating text classification in news portals, which can ultimately improve the efficiency of content management and user experience in online news platforms.
